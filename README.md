### 🚀 About Me

I’m a Platform / Site Reliability Engineer focused on building highly available cloud infrastructure and scalable distributed systems.

I specialize in turning complex architectures into reliable, observable, and automated platforms that engineering teams can depend on.

Currently working heavily across:

✅ Kubernetes platform engineering  
✅ Cloud infrastructure (Azure + multi-cloud exposure)  
✅ CI/CD 
✅ Observability and reliability design  
✅ Distributed system architecture  

I thrive in environments where uptime matters and systems operate at scale.

### 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

- Automate first — manual processes don’t scale  
- Reliability is a feature  
- Build platforms, not snowflakes  
- Prefer observability over guessing  
- Design for failure

### 🏗 Featured Project — Personal Kubernetes Platform

👉 **Production-style cluster built to mirror real-world infrastructure**

Stack includes:

- Kubernetes (OCI)
- KEDA autoscaling
- Prometheus + Grafana + Tempo
- Traefik / Gateway API
- Terraform infrastructure
- Datadog

**Goal:**  
Continuously evolve a production-grade platform to experiment with emerging patterns and showcase real-world architecture.
